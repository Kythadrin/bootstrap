    <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass
        one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System
        combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known
        to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed
        from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and is on average the
        third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.</p>
    <p>Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only
        about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the
        other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's
        shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer
        atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms
        along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to
        have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint
        planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has 79 known moons, including the four large
        Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater
        than that of the planet Mercury.</p>
    <p>Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet on December
        4, 1973; Pioneer 10 identified plasma in Jupiter's magnetic field and also found that Jupiter's magnetic
        tail was nearly 800 million kilometers long, covering the entire distance to Saturn. Jupiter has been
        explored on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby
        missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995. In late
        February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its
        speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered
        into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system
        include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.</p>
