    <p>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days,
        the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the
        messenger of the gods.</p>
    <p>Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance
        from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only
        be seen near the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight.
        At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe
        than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon,
        as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately
        116 days.</p>
    <p>Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2
        spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three
        times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of
        reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years.
        An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.</p>
    <p>Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about ​1⁄30 degree). Its orbital
        eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System; at perihelion, Mercury's distance
        from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears
        heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically
        inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures
        that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F)
        at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions. The polar regions are
        constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites.</p>
    <p>Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004,
        orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's
        surface on April 30, 2015. The BepiColombo spacecraft is planned to arrive at Mercury in 2025.</p>
